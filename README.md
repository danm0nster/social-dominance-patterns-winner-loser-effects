# Simulation data for _Aggression heuristics underlie animal dominance hierarchies and provide evidence of group-level social information_

Data for three different models of randomly directed aggression with varying
types of winner and loser effects are supplied here. The data are reported on in
detail in the Supplementary Information for the paper _Aggression heuristics
underlie animal dominance hierarchies and provide evidence of group-level social
information_.

The three sets of simulation data are characterized by the following values of the odds attack factor that modifies the attack probability of an agent after losing and winning:
1. **Realistic**: `loss_factor = 0.18, win_factor = 1.87`
2. **Moderate**: `loss_factor = 0.7, win_factor = 1.3`
3. **Extreme**: `loss_factor = 0.05, win_factor = 2.7`
