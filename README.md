**Authors**: Dan Mønster, Elizabeth Hobson, Simon DeDeo.

Data for three different models of randomly directed aggression with varying
types of winner and loser effects are supplied here. The data are reported on in
detail in the Supplementary Information for the paper

The three sets of simulation data are characterized by the following values of the odds attack factor that modifies the attack probability of an agent after losing and winning:
1. **Realistic**: `loss_factor = 0.18, win_factor = 1.87`
2. **Moderate**: `loss_factor = 0.7, win_factor = 1.3`
3. **Extreme**: `loss_factor = 0.05, win_factor = 2.7`
